## Setup

* [Generate GitHub appliation key](https://github.com/settings/developers) 
* [Generate GitHub access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
* Edit `conf/samson.conf`:
    * Set GitHub appliation credentials (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_SECRET`)
    * Set GitHub access token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`)
    * Set `SECRET_TOKEN` (random string with length of 128, can be generated with `openssl rand -hex 128| head -c 128`)
    * Set `DEFAULT_URL` (must be accessable url for SSO callbacks)
* Edit `etc/provision.yml` to setup public key fetching of `.ssh/known_hosts`
    * Fixed known_host keys can be stored inside `etc/known_hosts` folder and can be generated with `ssh-keyscan -H HOSTNAME > etc/known_hosts/HOSTNAME` (very secure)
    * All hosts without stored known_host keys will be automatically fetched when Dockerfile build is running (less secure)
* Add ssh keys to `ssh` (will be deployed to `/home/application/.ssh`) or generate an new one with `make ssh-key`
* Run `docker-compose up -d` or `make restart`

## Ansistrano deployment

For an easy project independed deployment you can use the predefined deployment runner (based on Ansistrano).

Use following as deployment command:

```
export DEPLOYMENT_INVENTORY=vagrant
export DEPLOYMENT_DEPLOY_TO=/var/www/target-deployment-path
/opt/ansistrano/deploy
```

or eg. for TYPO3 as application:

```
export DEPLOYMENT_INVENTORY=vagrant
export DEPLOYMENT_DEPLOY_TO=/var/www/target-deployment-path
export DEPLOYMENT_APPLICATION="typo3"
export TYPO3_CONTEXT="Production"
/opt/ansistrano/deploy
```

Common rsync excludes       | [deployment/rsync-excludes](ansistrano/rsync-excludes)

## PHP deployer
Use following as deployment command:

```
dep deploy
```

## Makefile

Command                     | Description
--------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------
`make restart`              | Restart Samson (and update/deploy configuration)
`make start`                | Start Samson
`make stop`                 | Stop Samson
`make log`                  | Show logs
`make update`               | Update Samson docker image (`docker pull`) and restart Samson

<br>                        |
`make backup`               | Run backup (app:/app/db/ will be copied to ./backup/db/)
`make restore`              | Run restore (./backup/db/ will be copied to app:/app/db/)
<br>                        |
`make shell`                | Jump into shell inside the container (as `application` user)
`make root`                 | Jump into shell inside the container (as `root` user)

## Project specific deployment

If you need a project specific deployment feel free to put your ansistrano deployment within your project sources.
Your deployment task should look like:

ansible-playbook -i inventory/server deploy.yml

## SSH - jump to servers behind gateways transparently

With ssh you can jump over multiple servers transparently to reach servers behinde ssh gateways, use the `ssh/config` 
file for configuration:

```
Host ssh-gateway
    Hostname ssh-gateway.example.com
    User foo

Host server-behind-gateway
    Hostname server-behind-ssh-gateway.example.com
    User     root
    ProxyCommand ssh ssh-gateway -W %h:%p
```

Now you can use `server-behind-gateway` as target host for SSH'ing at it will automatically jump over `ssh-gateway` to
reach this server.
