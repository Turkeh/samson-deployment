Installation
============

Requirements
------------

* Docker daemon
* GitHub application key (see https://github.com/settings/developers)
* GitHub access token (https://github.com/settings/tokens)

Installation
------------

Checkout from git:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Checkout master (stable) branch
    git clone https://github.com/webdevops/samson-deployment.git samson-deployment
    cd samson-deployment

    # Link favorite docker-compose.*.yml to docker-compose.yml
    ln -s docker-compose.local.yml docker-compose.yml


Setup Samson
------------


Setup ``conf/samson.conf`` file with following informations:

* ``DEFAULT_URL`` with application URL (GitHub will redirect users after login to this URL)
* ``GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`` and ``GITHUB_SECRET`` (GitHub application credentials)
* ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` (GitHub access token)
* ``SECRET_TOKEN`` with random string with 128 chars, can be generated with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        make SECRET_TOKEN

For building the Docker images locally you can use ``make all`` to start the build process.
There are multiple targets inside the Makefile for building only specific images eg. ``make webdevops/apache``


Setup SSH known hosts
---------------------

For deployment it's necessary to maintain valid ssh public keys inside ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` file inside the running
Docker container. This deployment doesn't disable known hosts checking because of security issues because it allows
MitM attacks.

Inside ``etc/provision.yml`` the hostnames of ssh servers can be setup and the ssh public server keys will automatically
fetched and added to ``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` inside the Docker container.

Because automatic fetching ssh public host keys can be unsecure it's also possible to add a file with prefetched keys. As
example there are some server keys from public servers (github, gitlab, bitbucket) configured.

Setup SSH public and private key
--------------------------------

Add public and private key to ``ssh/``, this directory will be copied into the Docker container to ``~application/.ssh``.


SSH advanced configuration
--------------------------

In ``ssh/config`` it's possible to set advanced ssh configuration options eg. different SSH ports or shorter ssh server
hostnames.

It's also possible to setup ssh proxy server to reach server behind another server with automatic ssh proxy connection::

    Host ssh-gateway
        Hostname ssh-gateway.example.com
        User foo

    Host server-behind-gateway
        Hostname server-behind-ssh-gateway.example.com
        User     root
        ProxyCommand ssh ssh-gateway -W %h:%p


Docker within deployment
------------------------

If you need Docker containers for deployment you have to use Docker privileged mode and enable the Docker daemon.

First enable the privileged mode inside ``docker-compose.yml``::

    privileged: true

then you also have to enable Docker service inside ``Dockerfile``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Enable Docker daemon
    # --> Also requies privileged mode in docker-compose.yml
    RUN /opt/docker/bin/control.sh service.enable docker

Start Samson
------------

To run or upload new configuration execute ``docker-compose up -d`` or ``make restart``.
